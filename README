DESCRIPTION

C<Inline::WebChat> is a module for letting you embed WebChat scripts in your Perl scripts.

Why would you wnat to do this? Well, Gisle Aas' WebChat is an Expect type langauage that
fetches and manipulates web pages and their forms. For example you can do stuff like

        GET http://www.perl.com
           EXPECT OK && /perl/ 
           GET not_there.html  
              EXPECT ERROR    
           BACK
        BACK   
        
... and ...

        GET http://www.altavista.com
                EXPECT OK
                F q=Gisle
                CLICK
                EXPECT OK && /Gisle Aas/
                
Which is obviously a lot easier than hand rolling your own code with C<LWP> and C<HTML::Forms> ...
... which is exactly what webchat does - take your WebChat script and convert it to pure Perl. Wh$why you can mix and match Perl and WebChat. Handy huh?
